# Load the module with all the functions
import xflow

# 1. PARAMETER DEFINITION
# All of the model parameters are set in this function
# p is a named tuple with the following parameters:
# L,R,pump_time,Trans_aq,Stora_aq,vect_t,dist_aq,q_pumped,Naq,Aq_well_connect
# Each can be accessed with the dot notation (eg. p.pump_time)
p = xflow.parameters()

# 2. FLOW VELOCITY DETERMINATION
# 2.1 Flow velocity computation from the developed forward model
# q_pump, q_obs = flow_velocity_computation(p)
WellsInterAq = xflow.flow_velocity_computation(p)
print(WellInterAq)
#

# 2.2 Conversion from [m/s] to [L/min]

# 3. PLOT RESULTS FOR FLOW VELOCITY COMPARISON
